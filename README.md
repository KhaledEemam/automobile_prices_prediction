# Automobile Price Prediction
This project focuses on predicting the prices of automobiles using machine learning techniques. It involves importing the data, assessing its quality, identifying and resolving any issues, 
performing data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), training machine learning models, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluating the model's performance on testing data.

## Project Workflow
* Data Import: The initial step involves importing the dataset into the project environment for further analysis and processing.
* Data Assessment: The dataset is assessed to identify any quality issues such as missing values, inconsistent formatting, outliers, etc.
* Data Cleaning: Quality issues identified in the assessment stage are addressed through data cleaning techniques such as imputation, outlier removal, and data transformation.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Using popular Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn, the project explores the dataset through various visualizations and statistical methods such as Pearson's correlation coefficient and p-value analysis.
* Model Training: Multiple machine learning models with default parameters are trained on the cleaned dataset to establish a baseline for performance comparison.
* Model Selection: The best performing model from the training phase is selected as the primary model for further optimization.
* Hyperparameter Tuning: The selected model's hyperparameters are fine-tuned using techniques such as grid search or random search to optimize its performance.
* Model Evaluation: The final tuned model is assessed on the testing data to evaluate its predictive capabilities and determine its effectiveness in price prediction.
